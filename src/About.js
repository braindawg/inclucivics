      In January 2015, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nashville.gov/Human-Relations-Commission.aspx">
      Metro Human Relations Commission</a> (MHRC) released the IncluCivics Report,
      analyzing the demographic makeup of 50 Metro Nashville departments. The data in the original
      report was provided by Metro Human Resources Metro HR in August 2014. Since then, Metro HR has
      provided more recent data captured April 1, 2015 and has announced that updated data will be
      released quarterly. The original IncluCivics Report, and a recent and more robust Data Update are
      available by clicking <a href='https://www.nashville.gov/Human-Relations-Commission/IncluCivics.aspx'>here</a>.

      This platform exists for
      two reasons. First, it is imperative to establish a baseline from which to assess our collective
      efforts at attaining a more diverse workforce in the future. Second, to further encourage
      transparency and public education, this platform will capture the demographic data provided
      quarterly by Metro HR, render it in user-friendly charts and graphs, and will track changes
      in the data over time. The raw data used on this platform is available to the public and can be
      found <a href='https://data.nashville.gov/Metro-Government/General-Government-Employees-Demographics/4ibi-mxs4'>here</a>.
      This platform was created and is maintained by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codefornashville.org">
      Code for Nashville</a>.
